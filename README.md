I decided to create a single page website with basic couple of sections you see on most of the corporate websites. Along with using Bootstrap to create responsive blocks, I tried to apply minimalism approach to this one.

Design Goals:
1. Interface should be Mobile Friendly
2. Interface should convey sense of calm and happiness.
3. Consider using animations 
4. 

This website is created using:

-> HTML5, CSS, and Bootstrap5.

-> For onscroll animations wowJS(+animate.css to create scroll reveal animations) is applied.

-> Google Fonts API


Some of the sample screenshots of the website:
