I decided to create a single page website with basic couple of sections you see on most of the corporate websites. Along with using Bootstrap to create responsive blocks, I tried to apply minimalism approach to this one.

This website is created using:

-> HTML5, CSS, and Bootstrap5.

-> For onscroll animations wowJS is applied.

-> Google Fonts API


Some of the sample screenshots of the website:
